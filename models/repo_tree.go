// TODO: Create TreeListing and RepoFile and other model objects here, and then
// open the necessary issues in the gitea repo to discuss designing the API endpoint

// With those model objects here, we can write tests for them and for TreeListing? Or maybe
// they should go elsewhere?

// Then we can write fuller integration tests, with model objects that we're expecting and asserting
// against
