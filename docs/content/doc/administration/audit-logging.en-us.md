# Audit Logging

Audit logging is used to track security related events and provide documentary evidence of the sequence of important activities.

**Table of Contents**

## Appenders

The audit log supports different appenders:

- `notice`: Log events as admin notices
- `log`: Log events as information to the configured Gitea logging
- `file`: Write events as JSON objects to a file

The config documentation lists all available options to configure audit logging with appenders.

## Events

Audit events are grouped by `user`, `organization`, `repository` and `system`.
