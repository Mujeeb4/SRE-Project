# Setup

The first time you access the Gitea web interface, the home page will appear. 
Clicking on "Register" or "Sign In" in the upper right corner will take you to 
the setup page.

After finishing the setup process, you will be directed to a page where you can 
create a user account. The first account created after setting up Gitea will be 
an admin account.
